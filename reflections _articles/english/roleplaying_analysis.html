            <h1>Roleplaying - Analysis based on my experience</h1>
            <p id = "date">Date: 11.12.2025</p>
            <p>
                I thought I was done with roleplaying a long time ago, but I was wrong. The harder I try to 
                control the excessive time I spend, the more I sink. To be honest, it's tiring.
            </p>
            <p>
                At first glance, roleplaying seemed just like a game to me. After all, it would theoretically be a game where instead of pressing buttons, you write down what you do and let the AI ​​continue and so on. But it's not really like that. There are some fundamental differences between regular games and roleplaying.
            </p>
            <p>
                The biggest and most important difference is that in roleplaying, you pretend to be someone else in a parallel world. It's like having a second life that's more appealing, but also toxic. In a normal game, you are you, but you have a different goal and some rules imposed to make the game fun. In roleplaying, you change your identity, the person. In a game, you change your goal. That's it.
            </p>
            <p>
                In roleplaying, there are no fixed rules, which means you can explore inappropriate scenarios, such as suicide attempts, bullying and rape. Games, while they can touch on such themes, do not allow you to explore such patterns deeply enough to matter.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you roleplay with an AI that allows its answers to regenerate, then each regeneration is like a game of chance in which the jackpot is an expressive, creative, but concise and precise answer. Other answers can make the roleplay much more interesting, which is why you end up hunting for them. I have had cases where I regenerated a single answer 50-60 times in search of the one that would make me laugh, that would make my roleplay as fun as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                A normal game, although it has elements where you can extract something at random several times to get something good, you cannot do this indefinitely like with regenerating the AIs answers in a roleplay. Roleplaying is almost like a free gambling game with infinite spins from this point of view.
            </p>
            <p>
                For someone who is not satisfied with themselves and wants to run away from their problems, roleplaying fits like a glove in satisfying these desires. It's just that these desires persist over time and then roleplaying has a high chance of becoming a vice. What scares me about this vice is that the identity becomes more and more blurred the deeper you sink and then it becomes complicated to return to real life and actually live it. Another problem with this vice is that by keeping yourself captive in a fictional reality, you make yourself neglect your real life, which makes reality even less attractive than before, and this in turn causes you to stay in the fictional world even more. It's a vicious cycle that is hard to escape from. And this can really destroy your life and your own identity.
